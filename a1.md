## Learning Goals of this Panel

*This panel will introduce you to the subject matter of this seminar - systems thinking and its implications for society. We will learn about the concept of “ideology” and its functioning in the social realm as a basis from which we start our inquiry.*

<br>

* Getting an idea of systems thinking and its lens on society

* Understanding what role “ideology” plays in society 

* Preparing to use this lens on the pandemic and beyond

# Part 1: Subject Matter of this Seminar and Introduction to Ideology

---

## What is Systemic Thinking?

* Loose collection of interdisciplinary study fields, ca. 1950

* Some thinkers, such as Niklas Luhmann, established their own, 
specific theories of systems, i.e., of society as a set of systems
	* Our next slide presents examples of this

--

* Systemic approaches are opposed to the general epistemological paradigm 
of western science, as established by Descartes’ mind-body dualism 
	* The observer is not distinct from the object, but rather part of the 
	object and imposes a unique perspective on his/her observations
	* Still, systemic thinking is not a paradigm that emerged outside of 
	western scientific tradition and shares a set of its presuppositions

--

* For our purposes: A tool or mental model for addressing questions in the social sciences

* Areas of application: Sociology, biology and ecosystems, 
economics, simulations, ...

---

## Part 1: Examples of Systems Thinking in the Social Sciences

* Luhmann's Systemic Theory

* Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action

* In terms of their systemic theories, Luhmann and Habermas were in dispute
	* Habermas: Luhmann's theory affirms the status quo of society
	* Luhmann: Habermas' ideas of altruistics and egaliatarian discourse are utopian 

---

## Part 1: A Systemic Thinker's Vocabulary

* Homeostasis

	* Systems maintaining a stable state (example: our body temperature)

--

* Cybernetics
	* The study of (auto-)regulatory systems (trivial example: thermostat)

--

* Cybernetic equivalence and emergence
	* Elements can not be deduced from a system’s behavior, a system's behavior 
	can not be deduced from its elements

--

* Autopoiesis
	* (Natural) systems able to create themselves out of themselves 
	(example: our body [cells], our ecosystem)

---

## Part 1: A Systemic Thinker's Vocabulary


* Chaos theory
	
	* Linear elements can cause non-linear outcomes in a deterministic fashion

--

* Non-trivial machines
	* Kicking a stone has a less trivial outcome than kicking a dog

--

* Second-order observers
	* The observer is part of the observation, the implications of which can be systematically studied (through observation)

<br>

*We will give you a reading list at the end of our seminar if you are interested*

---

## Elaborative Questions

Questions to reflect:

* How would you define systemic thinking in your own terms?

* Is systemic thinking scientific thinking?

* Is society actually a system?
	* What are limitations of this conceptualization?

# Part 2: On the Topic of Ideology

---

## Ideology

This input is designed to give participants an introduction into the theme of ideology. In line with some perspectives from the social sciences and philosophy, we shift our view from the negative connotation of the term to make it accessible as a working tool for our inquiry. This access allows us to consider (conflict-) dynamics in society and its various participants.

Ultimately, becoming aware of ideological presuppositions - your own and that of partners in discussion - is a precondition for more effective communication!

# Theoretical Input

## Ancient Origins of Ideology

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/An_Illustration_of_The_Allegory_of_the_Cave%2C_from_Plato%E2%80%99s_Republic.jpg" width="100%" alt="cave-allegory">

---

## Ancient Origins of Ideology

* “Allegory of the Cave” by Platon (Sheehan: no year)

* An allegory gives way to a hidden meaning

* Here: people’s sense of reality is different and we are bound by perspective

* Ideology as “an idea of the world” → distinct world view

---

## “Ideology”: a Dirty Word (Hawkes 2003)

* Originally designed as the “science of ideas” → ἰδέα idéa (idea) and λόγος lógos (teaching)

* Perceived as a threat under Napoleon → Since then “ideology” has often become a dirty word

* Ideology is “false opinion” and nothing legitimate

* Ideology can function as reasoning for totalitarianism

* Examples: Nazism, Communism

---

## Ideology and Systems Thinking

* We plead for a different understanding of ideology, in line with systems thinking!

→ we as observers of society are not independent from it


<br>
* Introducing a twofold shift of view:
	* “Ideology” as value-free term
	* Ideologies as necessary for the functioning of society

---

## I. Ideology as a Value Free Term

* We reject ideology as the embodiment of “false opinion”

	* “Human thinking is not constituted freely in social space, but on the contrary is always rooted in a certain place in it” (Mannheim 1978: 73).

* There is a variety of standpoints in society, each claiming a certain “truth”

* Working with ideology necessitates a flexible mindset in order to dive into the minds of others

---

## I. Ideology as a Value Free Term

* The content of an ideological standpoint might be “true”, yet thoroughly ideological

* The content of a standpoint might be “false”, yet there is nothing ideological about it

	* What matters is the claim to truth from which, in turn, a claim to power results
	* **Truth is power!**
	
* Power defined as the ability to motivate someone to think or do something that he/she would not have otherwise (Forst 2015: 115)

---

## Two Quick Examples
	
* “Corona is a made up by Bill Gates, <mark>we have to fight back</mark>!”
	* → Ideology, actor claims to know the “truth”

* “Corona is made up by Bill Gates”
	* no appeal, intention unclear, (could be a joke) → no Ideology

* Ideological substance depends on a subjects <mark>claim to power<mark>!

* Conclusion: “We are within ideological space proper the moment [...] ‘true’ or ‘false’ is functional with regard to some relation of [...] ‘power’” (Zizek 2012: 8)	

---

## II. Why Ideologies are Necessary for Society

* In systems thinking: ideologies function as orientation and justification for action (Luhmann 1991: 57)

<br>
* Ideologies are about “a view of good society”
** Ideology externalizes your inner beliefs (“individual truths”)

<br>
* Even you as participants can be seen as ideologues!

---

## II. Why Ideologies are Necessary for Society

* Different ideologies clash in society and are naturally inherent in politics

* Discussions and conflicts about “the good society” help us to move forward

* How do we analyze this? → suggesting ideology critique as a tool

<img src="https://civis.cborchers.com/img/ideology.png" width="60%" alt="ideology-venn" class="center">

---

## Ideology Critique: Who? (Zürn and de Wilde 2016)

* Who are the subjects of the (ideological) conflict?

* Social groups and different kinds of ideological expertise

* Amateurs vs. ideological experts (leading speakers) and institutions (government, newspaper, societies)

---

## Ideology Critique: What? (Zürn and de Wilde 2016)

* The notion of (public) discourse gives a broader framework

* Actors and institutions function within discourses
	* Discourse in the broader sense (Habermas):

* The negotiation process of claims of validity of different actors (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2017)
	* Ideologies partake here because societal conflicts are negotiated in discourse

---

## Ideology Critique: How? (Zürn and de Wilde 2016)


* We need to locate and identify key areas of conflict
	
	* → “bones of contestation” (Zürn & de Wilde 2016: 280)

* For us especially important: what are areas/issues of contention in the pandemic? (Panel A2)

* For “Critical Discourse Analysis”, we need empirical material:

	* Newspapers, videos, podcasts, … what else?

---

## Our Takeaway

* How do we escape a sheer amount of ideological standpoints?

<br>

> “Perhaps the higher task lies in learning to think relationally and dynamically, but not statically” (Mannheim 1978: 77).

<br>

<b>→ dynamic relationism</b>
